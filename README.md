Hey!

I'm Jasim, a self-described "Data All-Rounder" that loves mountains, big cities and small towns. I worked in Finance for ten years and decided to pursue a deep interest in data-related stuff. I spent the last six months learning data science, and this repository is a place where you can find all my work.

Feel free to reach out!

### What I'm working on:

- I'm currently working on Bridges to Prosperity 🌉
- I have worked on Kickstarter Success predictions 🥾🎬
- I have analyzed New York City restaurant datasets 🗽
- I'm looking for help on scraping web data s🧽
- Ask me about Financial Risk Management 🏦
